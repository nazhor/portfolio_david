ptext = "The Fall of Lazarus wasn't a comercial success, quite the contrary. Some time after launch, Johnny told me that he wanted to write a report telling all about the development of The Fall of Lazarus and our company (yes, everything, including the most difficult parts). The postmortem made a lot of noise in the Spanish developer community. It was published in GameReport(Spanish) and Gamedeveloper/Gamasutra(English). Later on, one of the readers filmed a documentary telling the very same story and that's Cave Mode."
