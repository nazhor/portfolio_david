ptext = "No Wand Studios was the company I founded along with Johnny and other people. During this time I made a lot of differents taks and projects, from games likes the ones you can see on this pages to serious games using the old Oculus DevKit. I also took care of the accounting and bureaucracy of the company. The company was not a sucess but the skills I developed during the time I was managing the company are priceless."
